# Usage

Provide the URL of the relevant API under test (see the detailed description on the webpage) and select a test suite from the checklist. The result of the tests will be shown after a few seconds.

The result of each test case will be one of the following:

| Pass | Reason |
| - | - |
| ![Pass](https://place-hold.it/128x32/28a745.png?text=Pass&fontsize=12&bold) | Successful test case. |
| ![Fail](https://place-hold.it/128x32/dc3545.png?text=Fail&fontsize=12&bold) | Required feature of the specification has been found to be implemented incorrectly. |
| ![Warning](https://place-hold.it/128x32/ffc107.png?text=Warning&fontsize=12&bold) | Not a failure, but the API being tested is responding or configured in a way which is not recommended in most cases. |
| ![Test Disabled](https://place-hold.it/128x32/ffc107.png?text=Test%20Disabled&fontsize=12&bold) | Test is disabled due to test suite configuration; change the config or test manually. |
| ![Could Not Test](https://place-hold.it/128x32/ffc107.png?text=Could%20Not%20Test&fontsize=12&bold) | Test was not run due to prior responses from the API, which may be OK, or indicate a fault. |
| ![Not Implemented](https://place-hold.it/128x32/ffc107.png?text=Not%20Implemented&fontsize=12&bold) | Recommended/optional feature of the specifications has been found to be not implemented. |
| ![Manual](https://place-hold.it/128x32/007bff.png?text=Manual&fontsize=12&bold) | Test suite does not currently test this feature, so it must be tested manually. |
| ![Not Applicable](https://place-hold.it/128x32/6c757d.png?text=Not%20Applicable&fontsize=12&bold) | Test is not applicable, e.g. due to the version of the specification being tested. |

## Advanced Testing

Some of the tests contained within this tool perform a number of steps which may not be obvious without viewing the source code. To help with debugging, descriptions of such behaviour is covered by the [advanced testing](5.0._Advanced_Testing.md) pages.

# Usage

Open a browser and go to the address of the server you [deployed](1.0._Deployment.md).

Provide the URL of the relevant API under test (see the detailed description on the webpage) and select a test suite from the checklist. The result of the tests will be shown after a few seconds.

The result of each test case will be one of the following:

| Pass | Reason |
| - | - |
| ![Pass](https://place-hold.it/128x32/28a745.png?text=Pass&fontsize=12&bold) | Successful test case. |
| ![Fail](https://place-hold.it/128x32/dc3545.png?text=Fail&fontsize=12&bold) | Required feature of the specification has been found to be implemented incorrectly. |
| ![Warning](https://place-hold.it/128x32/ffc107.png?text=Warning&fontsize=12&bold) | Not a failure, but the API being tested is responding or configured in a way which is not recommended in most cases. |
| ![Test Disabled](https://place-hold.it/128x32/ffc107.png?text=Test%20Disabled&fontsize=12&bold) | Test is disabled due to test suite configuration; change the config or test manually. |
| ![Could Not Test](https://place-hold.it/128x32/ffc107.png?text=Could%20Not%20Test&fontsize=12&bold) | Test was not run due to prior responses from the API, which may be OK, or indicate a fault. |
| ![Not Implemented](https://place-hold.it/128x32/ffc107.png?text=Not%20Implemented&fontsize=12&bold) | Recommended/optional feature of the specifications has been found to be not implemented. |
| ![Manual](https://place-hold.it/128x32/007bff.png?text=Manual&fontsize=12&bold) | Test suite does not currently test this feature, so it must be tested manually. |
| ![Not Applicable](https://place-hold.it/128x32/6c757d.png?text=Not%20Applicable&fontsize=12&bold) | Test is not applicable, e.g. due to the version of the specification being tested. |

## Test-specific Documentation

The following pages provide information on additional instructions for testing specific features:

- [Unicast Discovery](2.1._Usage_-_Testing_Unicast_Discovery.md)
- [BCP-003-01](2.2._Usage_-_Testing_BCP-003-01_TLS.md)
- [Authorization](2.3._Usage_-_Testing_IS-10_Authorization.md)
- [SDP Files](2.4._Usage_-_Testing_of_SDP_Files.md)

## Non-interactive Testing

The testing tool supports two modes of operation that support usage in larger scale or continuous integration tests.

- [Non-Interactive Mode](2.5._Usage_-_Non-Interactive_Mode.md)
- [Using the API](2.6._Usage_-_Using_the_API.md)

## External Dependencies

- Python 3
- Git
- [testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh) (required for BCP-003-01 testing)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (required for BCP-003-01 OCSP testing)
- libssl-dev (Linux users only, required for IS-10 testing)
- [SDPoker](https://github.com/Streampunk/sdpoker) (required for IS-05 SDP - ing)
- See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for additional packages

## Advanced Testing

Some of the tests contained within this tool perform a number of steps which may not be obvious without viewing the source code. To help with debugging, descriptions of such behaviour is covered by the [advanced testing](5.0._Advanced_Testing.md) pages.

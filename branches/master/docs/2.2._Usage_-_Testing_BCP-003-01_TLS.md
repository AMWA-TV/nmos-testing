# Testing BCP-003-01 TLS

Testing of certain aspects of BCP-003-01 makes use of an external tool 'testssl.sh'. Please see [testssl/README.md](https://github.com/peterbrightwell/nmos-testing/blob/master/testssl/README.md) for installation instructions.

In order to ease testing of TLS with the various specifications, sample certificates are provided in this repository. Please see [test_data/BCP00301/README.md](https://github.com/peterbrightwell/nmos-testing/blob/master/test_data/BCP00301/README.md) for their details and installation guidance.

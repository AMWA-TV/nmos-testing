# Testing IS-10 Authorization

When testing IS-10 / BCP-003-02 implementations, ensure that a user is registered with the Authorization Server with a
username and password that corresponds with the `AUTH_USERNAME` and `AUTH_PASSWORD` config options in the
`nmostesting/Config.py` file. These values should be changed to sensible values before running the IS-10 tests
and will be used as the Basic Authentication mechanism when contacting the Authorization Server.

When testing dynamic client registration, the contents of `/test_data/IS1001/register_client_request_data.json` will be used in
the body of the request when registering the client, and should comply with [RFC7591](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591). When
testing the authorization code grant, the means by which consent is given by the resource owner will be implementation-specific.
The contents of the file `/test_data/IS1001/authorization_request_data.json` will be used as the body of the request to the
authorization endpoint. **Please edit both files** to comply with the implementation under test.

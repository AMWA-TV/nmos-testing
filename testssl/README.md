# testssl.sh

In order to test BCP-003-01, the 'testssl.sh' script (v3.0 rc5) must be placed in this directory with 'execute' permission enabled. This tool is known to work on Linux and Mac OS, but requires [Ubuntu terminal](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows) for usage on Windows. Note that the Linux VM approach on Windows will be significantly slower to run than a pure Linux system.

Please download the required files using the following link, then untar the results into this directory:
<https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/archive/3.0rc5.tar.gz>

Alternatively, use the following command which can be executed from within this 'testssl' directory.

```shell
wget https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh/archive/3.0rc5.tar.gz
tar -xvzf 3.0rc5.tar.gz --strip-components=1
```

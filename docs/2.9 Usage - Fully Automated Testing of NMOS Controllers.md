# Testing NMOS Controllers

## Fully Automated NMOS Controller Tests

The testing tool supports fully automated testing of NMOS Controllers by replacing the Testing Fa�ade with your own application to receive and process the requests from the NMOS Testing Tool. A full example utilising Flask and Selenium can be found on the nmos-js repository under AutomatedTesting. 

## Building your fully automated test interface

The Testing Fa�ade IP/Hostname and Port on the test suite should be set to the location of your application.
POST requests are sent from the Test Suite to the API endpoint `{IP/hostname}:{Port}/x-nmos/testing-facade` 

The JSON data in the request is as follows:
```shell
{
    'test_type': 'radio', 'checkbox' or 'action',
    'question_id': unique to each individual question,
    'name': name of test,
    'description': description of test,
    'question': question,
    'answers': answers dictionary: {'answer_id': unique str, 'label': resource label, 'description': resource description, 'id': resource id, 'answer_str': a string combining all this information},
    'time_sent': time.time(),
    'timeout': time in seconds for test suite to wait for answer to be POSTed to url_for_response, default 600
    'url_for_response': url of test suite API endpoint to signal an answer has been posted,
    'answer_response': empty string,
    'time_answered': empty string,
    'metadata': dict of extra information needed to aid fully automated testing where specific resources are included in the question
}
```

An example class for storing and retrieving this data can be found at `testingfacade/DataStore.py`

On receiving a POST request from the Testing Tool, your application should use the question id to instruct your chosen automated test framework (eg. Selenium) to carry out the required tasks on your Controller and return appropriate answers.

Some test have multiple questions, all of which must be answered correctly to pass the test. 

There are three types of question that requires different answer formats:
- Radio - return a single answer string of the answer_id from the answers dict
- Checkbox - return multiple answer strings of answer_id's from the answers dict in a list
- Action - no answers given, return the string 'Next' once the required actions have been completed

Your application should POST the answer(s) to the url given in `url_for_response`. This POST request should contain the entire json response originally received from the test suite with your answer(s) in the `answer_response` field and the current time in the `time_answered` field. The test suite will process the answer then send the next question. If no answer is received by the test suite within the timeout period, the test will expire and the first question of the next test will be sent.

The test suite begins with a pre_tests_message and ends with a post_tests_message. These should be treated as action questions and return 'Next' to begin/end the actual tests.

# Installing the Testing Tool

The tool can be deployed either locally or by using a Docker container. The Docker version is pre-installed with all of the required dependencies, so may involve fewer steps to get started.

- [On a local machine](1.1.%20Installation%20-%20Local.md)
- [In a Docker container](1.2.%20Installation%20-%20Docker.md)

## Configuration

The testing tool has a number of general configuration settings that affect its operation, defined in `nmostesting/Config.py`.
 
To alter these, copy `nmostesting/UserConfig.example.py` to `nmostesting/UserConfig.py` and make your changes there.

Further guidance is given in [Usage](2.0.%20Usage.md#configuration).

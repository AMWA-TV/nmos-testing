# Testing of SDP files

## Senders

IS-05-01 test_41 checks that SDP files of Senders conform to the expectations of SMPTE ST.2110 and various IETF RFCs.
In order to enable these tests, please ensure that [SDPoker](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/sdpoker) is available on your system.

## Receivers

Test cases like IS-04-01 test_13 and IS-05-02 test_18 check that SDP files generated by the testing tool are accepted by Receivers.
In order to pass these tests, `SDP_PREFERENCES` can be set to override the default SDP media parameters used by the testing tool to match the format of the node under test.

Further guidance on changing configuration settings is given in [Configuration](2.0.%20Usage.md#configuration).

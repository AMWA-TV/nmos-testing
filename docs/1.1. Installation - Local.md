# Deploying Locally

## Dependencies

Please ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your system first.

- Python 3.5 or higher, including the 'pip' package manager
- Git
- [testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh) (required for BCP-003-01 testing, see our [README](../testssl/README.md) for instructions)
- [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) (required for BCP-003-01 OCSP testing)

## Installation Method

The following instructions will need to be carried out at the command line. This will require either a terminal application on Linux, or the 'Command Prompt' application on Windows. On some more modern installations, 'pip3' and 'python3' will be unavailable. In these cases, it should be possible to replace these commands with 'pip' and 'python' respectively.

Ensure pip3 is installed and up to date.

```shell
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```

Download a copy of the testing tool and unzip it to a local directory: <https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-testing/archive/master.zip>

From the directory containing the testing tool, install the dependencies.

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the service as follows:

```shell
python3 nmos-test.py
```

This tool provides a simple web service which is available on `http://localhost:5000`.

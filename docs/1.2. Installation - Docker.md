# Deploying with Docker

There is a Dockerfile provided to build an image containing the testing tool. A pre-built version of this container can be downloaded from Docker Hub as follows.

```shell
docker pull amwa/nmos-testing
```

This image provides a quick way for deploying the testing tool in your network.

```shell
docker run -d -p="5000:5000" -p "5001:5001" amwa/nmos-testing
```

The Testing Tool web service will be available on `http://<DOCKER_HOST_IP>:5000`.
The Testing Fa√ßade for semi-automatic [Controller Tests](2.8.%20Usage%20-%20Testing%20Controllers.md) will be available on `http://<DOCKER_HOST_IP>:5001`.

If you need to specify custom `UserConfig.py` settings, you can add the following volume mount. _Note_: requires an absolute path, the example below is for working from current directory.

```shell
docker run -d -p="5000:5000" -p "5001:5001" -v="$(pwd)/UserConfig.py:/config/UserConfig.py" amwa/nmos-testing
```

If you need to deploy multiple instances of the testing tool for multiple users to have concurrent access, this is a possible method to meet those requirements.

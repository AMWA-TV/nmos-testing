# Deploying with Docker

There is a Dockerfile provided to build an image containing the testing tool. A pre-built version of this container can be downloaded from Docker Hub as follows.

```shell
docker pull amwa/nmos-testing
```

This image provides a quick way for deploying the testing tool in your network from a Linux host. (Host networking is used to ensure the mock APIs created for many of the test suites are easily accessible to other hosts on your network. Docker does not support host networking on Windows or Mac.)

```shell
docker run -d --network="host" amwa/nmos-testing
```

The Testing Tool web service will be available on `http://<DOCKER_HOST_IP>:5000`.
The Testing Fa√ßade for semi-automatic [Controller Tests](2.8.%20Usage%20-%20Testing%20Controllers.md) will be available on `http://<DOCKER_HOST_IP>:5001`.

If you need to specify custom `UserConfig.py` settings, you can add the following volume mount. _Note_: requires an absolute path, the example below is for working from current directory.

```shell
docker run -d --network="host" -v="$(pwd)/UserConfig.py:/config/UserConfig.py" amwa/nmos-testing
```

If you need to deploy multiple instances of the testing tool for multiple users to have concurrent access, this is a possible method to meet those requirements.

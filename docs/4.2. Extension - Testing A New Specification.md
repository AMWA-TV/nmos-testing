# Testing a New Specification

When adding tests for a completely new API, the first set of basic tests have already been written for you. Provided a specification is available in the standard NMOS layout (using RAML 1.0), the test suite can automatically download and interpret it. Simply create a new test file which looks like the following:

```python
from .GenericTest import GenericTest


class MyNewSpecTest(GenericTest):
    """
    Runs MyNewSpecTest
    """
    def __init__(self, apis):
        GenericTest.__init__(self, apis)
```

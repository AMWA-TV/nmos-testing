# Testing BCP-003-01 TLS

BCP-003-01 covers the use of Transport Layer Security with NMOS APIs. The BCP-003-01 Secure API Communications test suite can be run against an implementation of any of the APIs running in HTTPS mode to confirm that the requirements of BCP-003-01 are met.

Testing of certain aspects of BCP-003-01 makes use of an external tool 'testssl.sh'. Please see [testssl/README.md](../testssl/README.md) for installation instructions.

In order to ease testing of TLS with the various specifications, sample certificates are provided in this repository. Please see [test_data/BCP00301/README.md](../test_data/BCP00301/README.md) for their details and installation guidance.

In addition to the specific test suite, each of the specification test suites can be run in HTTPS mode where applicable. When this is enabled, every request which is made by the testing tool will use HTTPS. The configuration parmaeter `ENABLE_HTTPS` should be set to `True` before running the Testing Tool.

# Testing IS-07 MQTT

When testing IS-07 MQTT implementations, ensure that nodes are pre-configured to send messages to a broker.

* The test suite does not start a broker.
* The broker used must support MQTT version 5.
* The test suite must be able to connect to the broker(s) specified in the active sender parameters and subscribe to the appropriate topics.
* The config parameters `MQTT_USERNAME` and `MQTT_PASSWORD` may be changed to specify authentication details for connecting to the broker.

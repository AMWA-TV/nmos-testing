# Semi-automatic Client Testing

To run the Semi-automatic Client Tests:

Launch the Client Façade from the clientfacade directory. By default the Client Façade will run on port 5001
```shell
python3 ClientFacade.py
```

Launch the NMOS Testing tool in the usual way.

In the NMOS Testing Tool select 'JT-NM Client Tests' and configure the IP/Hostname to that of the machine running the Client Facade (e.g. localhost) and the Port to the Client Facade's port (use 5001 by default)

Select and launch the tests from the NMOS Testing tool, and follow the instructions displayed on the Client Façade.

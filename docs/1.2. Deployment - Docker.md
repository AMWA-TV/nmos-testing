# Deploying with Docker

There is a Dockerfile provided to build an image containing the testing tool.

```shell
docker build -t nmos-testing .
```

This image provides a quick way for deploying the testing tool in your network.

```shell
docker run -d -p="5000:5000" nmos-testing
```

The web service will be available on `http://<DOCKER_HOST_IP>:5000`.

If you need to change the `Config.py` settings. You can define your own copy with the required settings and add the following volume mount. _Note_: requires an absolute path, the example below is for working from current directory.

```shell
docker run -d -p="5000:5000" -v="$(pwd)/Config.py:/config/Config.py" nmos-testing
```

If you need to deploy multiple instances of the testing tool for multiple users to have concurrent access, this is a possible method to meet those requirements.
